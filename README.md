# Data-FAIRification
Data FAIRification: Ontology cross-reference and mapping service

Problem Statement

As the data is being annotated on a larger scale and are described using controlled terminologies or ontology standards. Multiple ontologies are available for any given domain, so the ability to map related or similar concepts is the necessity for data integration. Several techniques and tools have emerged that support ontology mapping, but finding and harmonising mappings from multiple sources remains a challenge for users.

Aim

To address the above issue we have developed OAAS, a repository of known ontology mappings and cross-references extracted from multiple datasources. Our system enhances publically available ontologies by finding correspondences (mappings and cross-references) between different ontologies across different domains i.e, harmonising mappings from multiple datasources which facilitates semantic search and improve discoverabilities without compromising on the quality. 

About OAAS:

OAAS is a comprehensive semantic repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions, enriched terminologies at one place. You can browse the ontologies through the this tool. OAAS provides a Web interface and API to access mappings.
Features:
	Add Context (meta-data) to data
	Intergrate data silos
	Facilitate ensemble data/text analytics and visualization
	Monthly Content Update
	Scalable
	
Mapping Service Include:
	Periodic updation
	ML based approach
	Fuzzy matching
	Version management
	XRef based mapping

OAAS is developed and maintained by the Ontology Experts at MC labs.


Example:
Enhanced MeSH Vocabulary

The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus is a controlled and hierarchically-organized vocabulary produced by the National Library of Medicine. It is used for indexing, cataloging, and searching of biomedical and health-related information. MeSH includes the subject headings appearing in MEDLINE/PubMed, the NLM Catalog, and other NLM databases. 

We in MCLabs enhanced the MeSH Vocabulary by mapping the concepts with publically available ontologies by enabling XRef mappings and pubishing data in RDF platform for further analysis and visualization. Find current enhancement stats below:

MeSH Vocabulary :
Current MeSH Disease:
	MeSH disease Terms: 9174
    Synonyms: 58557
	DBXrefs: 0

Using OAAS current MeSH Disease concept has been enhanced to:
	MeSH disease Terms: 9174
    Synonyms: ~98040
	DBXrefs: ~22394
